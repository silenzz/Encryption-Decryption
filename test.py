       "Fairytale Hairdresser series will be familiar to many six-year-olds. Her career relies on the vivid images " \
       "that leap into her mind's eye when she reads text from her author. When I met her in her box-room studio " \
       "in Manchester, she was working on a dramatic scene in the next book. The text describes " \

str2 = "A notorious Mexican drug baron’s audacious escape from prison in July doesn’t, at first, appear to have much " \
       "to teach corporate boards. But some in the business world suggest otherwise. Beyond the morally " \
       "reprehensible side of criminals' work, some business gurus say organised crime syndicates, computer hackers, " \
       "pirates and others operating outside the law could teach legitimate corporations a thing or two about " \
       "how to hustle and respond to rapid change. Joaquin Guzman, the head of the Mexican Sinaloa drug cartel, " \
       "for instance, slipped out of his prison cell through a tiny hole in his shower that led to a mile-long " \
       "tunnel fitted with lights and ventilation. Making a break for it required creative thinking, " \
       "long-term planning and perseverance – essential skills similar to those needed to achieve success " \
       "in big business."

str3 = "The COVID-19 pandemic has caused many severe damages to people’s lives. It affected all aspects of existence: " \
       "medicine, economics, and politics. Without any doubt, it also influenced sports and practically all kinds of " \
       "physical facilities as fitness centers, gyms, and sport clubs were closed. Therefore, many people are not able to " \
       "actively engage outside of their homes in their regular group or individual sporting or physical activities. " \
       "Even after most of the facilities were open, attending them would still bear a serious risk, as well as the fact " \
       "that people have to maintain social distancing regulations and train in masks making it quite uncomfortable. " \
       "Currently, people are facing a new reality and new rules of life that they need to accept but it is important " \
       "that fitness enthusiasts find a way to stay physically active even in these given circumstances. " \
       "The World Health Organization recommends about two and a half hours of reasonable exercise, or about an " \
       "hour and a half of hard training a week. However, people have found ways to stay active, healthy, and be " \
       "in good shape under these circumstances as there are always limitless opportunities for practicing at home, " \
       "online, or outside, taking the required precautions."

str4 = "Life in lockdown has been difficult because people need to stay healthy, while still remaining safe and adhering " \
       "to the new rules. During the self-isolation period, the population became used to a sedentary lifestyle with little " \
       "physical activity and practically no exercise. It has been hard even for professional sportsmen who had to modify " \
       "their training programs so they could exercise at home. For the population at risk, doctors advise to use home " \
       "equipment for sports, such as treadmills, elliptical machines, and stationary bikes. Today, it is not hard to " \
       "find guides for training at home; any person can access the Internet and find advice for activities that would " \
       "be comfortable. There are ways for online training with a real coach that would develop an individual program " \
       "for exercising and would help one to stay in good shape. There are even professional athletes who give instructions " \
       "to people on how to stay physically active during the lockdown. Some of the experts manage to demonstrate different " \
       "exercises that could be done at home, others give guidelines for a healthy diet. Today, it is possible to buy " \
       "all the necessary equipment for training at home. Even ordinary exercises that everyone can do without special " \
       "fitness machines are useful. Everybody can make squats, side bends, jumps, press-ups, and many other basic " \
       "elements of gymnastics. For those people, who cannot do heavier exercise, doctors suggest having regular walks. " \
       "Moreover, it is usual practice now to go to the backyard and throw a ball around or play other games. However, " \
       "contact sports such as football or basketball with friends or strangers are still considered to be dangerous as " \
       "they can result in the increase of the number of infections. Today, gyms and sports facilities should organize " \
       "their space in a way to prevent the virus from spreading. It is preferable that all the activities that could be " \
       "done outside were moved there as it is much safer."
